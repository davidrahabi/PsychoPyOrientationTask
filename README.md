# Orientation Discrimination Task

## Overview
This project is a PsychoPy-based experiment designed to study orientation discrimination using visual gratings and masks. Participants are presented with a grating of a specific orientation, followed by a mask, and must determine whether the grating's orientation changed clockwise or counterclockwise. The experiment employs an adaptive staircase procedure to dynamically adjust difficulty based on participant performance, enabling precise measurement of perceptual sensitivity.

## Features
- **Stimulus Presentation**: Visual gratings and masks to study orientation perception.
- **Adaptive Staircase**: Dynamically adjusts the difficulty level to match participant performance.
- **Data Logging**: Captures responses, accuracy, and trial conditions for detailed analysis.

## Project Goals
This experiment aims to:
- Investigate orientation discrimination thresholds in participants.
- Measure perceptual sensitivity using an adaptive staircase method.
